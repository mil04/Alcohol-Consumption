## Plots

### 1. Death rate because of excessive alcohol use depending on Country and Year
The left graph shows the top 20 countries by average number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants per year due to excessive alcohol consumption (1990 - 2019). It turns out that the leaders are Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine. 

The right graph shows the change in the average number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants per year over 30 years (1990 - 2019). Top 10 countries from the left graph, located in Europe, were chosen for this graph. It can be seen that Belarus is the leader in the number of deaths per year since 2009. Also, an increasing trend can be seen in Finland, Denmark, Poland, and Moldova during these years. The downward trend is seen in Russia, Ukraine, and Estonia in the 2000s. A sharp decline is noticed at the end of the 1990s in Lithuania.

### 2. Percent of people who began drinking before age 13
Despite the legal drinking age being 18 years (for many countries), the majority start drinking at an earlier age. The map of Europe illustrates the prevalence of individuals who first tried alcohol before age 13. The study was conducted among 15-year-olds by the World Health Organization (2014). The highest percentage of individuals consuming alcohol before the age of 13 is in Estonia, at 49%, with Greece and Lithuania following closely at 43%. Conversely, Iceland reports the lowest percentage, a mere 5%, while Poland has 32%.

### 3. Percentage of men vs. women who drank alcohol in the past year
This graph shows the percentage of women and men who drank alcohol at least once in the past year (2016) for each country. It is noticeable that in all countries, the percentage of men who drank in the past year is higher than the percentage of women. All countries except 4 (Luxembourg, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) line up in something similar to a parabola branch. For the 4 outliers, it is observed that women drink almost as much alcohol as men. By continent, the highest percentage for both women and men is in Europe, and the lowest is in Asia, Africa, and Oceania (except Australia and New Zealand).
